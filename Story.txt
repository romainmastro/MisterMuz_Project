Introduction : 

	Muz woke up from a good long nap!
	Brrrrr it's cold outside! And... snowy!
	But...Why is it so cold inside his cozy hole?
	What the Cheese! His door was opened! Someone was here!
	He saw traces on the floor!
	He searched his house from bottom to top but couldn't lay his cute paws on his scarf, 
	his 4 gloves and the special woolen hat his mom had knit for him!
	What a disaster!
	Muz packed a few of his tastiest cheese and, a shiver down his spine, went outside in the 
	cold...

GOAL : 

	Go through 3 levels to find his missing clothes but Muz must eat cheese at regular interval or 
	he will freeze!
